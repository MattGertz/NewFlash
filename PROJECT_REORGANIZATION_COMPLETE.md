# FileSyncLibrary Project Reorganization

## Structure Improvements

The FileSyncLibrary project has been fully reorganized for better maintainability and organization:

### Before:
- Examples and demos were scattered across multiple locations
- Standalone example files in root directory (`ComprehensiveDemo.cs`, `ErrorHandlingDemo.cs`, `Examples.cs`)
- Inconsistent namespaces between examples and main library

### After:
- All demonstration code consolidated in the `Demo` project
- Consistent namespace (`FileSyncLibrary.Demo`) across all example files
- Organized command-line interface with multiple demo options
- Comprehensive dry run implementation complete

## Demo Project Structure

### Core Demo Files:
- `Program.cs`: Main entry point with command routing
- `DryRunDemo.cs`: Specialized dry run demonstration
- `ComprehensiveDemo.cs`: Complete library feature showcase
- `ErrorHandlingDemo.cs`: Error handling capabilities
- `Examples.cs`: Collection of usage examples

### Command-Line Options:
```
dotnet run                 # Default retry demo
dotnet run dryrun          # Dry run demo
dotnet run comprehensive   # Comprehensive feature demo
dotnet run errorhandling   # Error handling demo
dotnet run examples        # Collection of examples
dotnet run all             # Run all demos in sequence
```

## Features Demonstrated

The reorganized demo project effectively demonstrates all main library features:

- ✅ **Core File Synchronization**: Basic file copying with regex patterns
- ✅ **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates during synchronization 
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures
- ✅ **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- ✅ **Cancellation Support**: Responsive operation cancellation
- ✅ **Concurrency Control**: Configurable parallel processing
- ✅ **Dry Run Mode**: Preview operations without making changes

## Documentation Updates

- README.md updated with comprehensive dry run documentation
- Complete API reference including the new dry run parameter
- Example code for all major features
- Usage instructions for command-line operations

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**: All examples and demos in dedicated project
2. **Better Maintainability**: Consistent naming and structure 
3. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Clear separation of core library and examples
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features fully tested with unit tests and demo code
5. **Complete Documentation**: Dry run implementation documented extensively

## Next Steps

The FileSyncLibrary is now ready for production use with comprehensive documentation, testing, and example code. Future enhancements could include:

1. Nuget package publication
2. Additional configuration options
3. Enhanced progress reporting with events
4. More advanced regex pattern examples
